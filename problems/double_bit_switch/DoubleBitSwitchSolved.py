"""
problem formalization:

You are given 2 arrays:
1. A, N-sized integers array.
2. B, N-sized binary array.
The values of A are constant, but ou are allowed to change the values of B by performing a double bit switch (DBS):
In a double bit switch, you choose two adjacent bit in B and perform NOT operation on both of them (reminder: NOT(0)
 = 1, NOT(1) = 0).
 You can use the the double bit switch operation as many times as you want.

Create an EFFICIENT algorithm to find the maximum value of dot product that can be achieved by performing the DBS
operation over B.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:

input: A = [-8, 12, 27, 4, 13, -8, 6], B = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
output: 58

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations:

time - 0.5 seconds
space - no limitation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing:

After implementing your solution, test it with out given input by 'CheckSolution' file.
You have a total of 6 test:
- tests 1-3 are visible to you, and you can access it's input using 'get_input' method from utils.Test.
- test 4 is not visible to you, and need to pass them without knowing the input.
It is assured to you that all input is legal and fits the solution signature.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation:

After passing all tests, write a doc in Confluence describing your solution.
In the doc, analyze the runtime of the algorithm you used.

    idea:
    We can notice that we can perform Not on any couple of bits (even if not adjacent) by performing DBS over all the
    adjacent bits between them. Therefore, the only invariant of B is the parity (is the amount of 1's even or odd).
    
    So, we will try to maximize the fot-product by substituting 1 at every bit in B corresponding to positive number in
    A, and 0 otherwise. if the parity fails, we change the parity of the smallest (absolute value) one.
